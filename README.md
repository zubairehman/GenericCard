# generic_card_widget

A re-usable card widget so that you can import and use it everywhere in the app without putting up the layout again and again.

## Getting Started

One way or another you may want to display some “items”, be it an album, an e-commerce product, social media feed, with a title, a subtitle, few lines of body text, and of course an image. Unlike other Flutter widgets such as AppBar, CheckBoxTile, SwitchTile, for which you can have neat layouts ready-made, Card widget only gives you “a rectangle with elevation”. You need to figure out your way to put things in it beautifully. Material Components Web’s catalogue page gives us 5 different layers to reference from. This widget hs been designed to keep provided material guidlines in mind.
